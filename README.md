**"Java-Auth-System is a powerful and secure Java-based authentication system that combines traditional and biometric authentication methods to enhance security. It utilizes JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for secure token-based authentication, ensuring safe session management. Additionally, the system integrates facial recognition using DeepFace and OpenCV, allowing users to authenticate seamlessly through biometric verification.

The user interface is built with JavaFX, providing a modern and interactive experience. To further enhance security, the system includes an account lockout mechanism that temporarily blocks users after multiple failed login attempts, preventing brute-force attacks.

To use this system, OpenCV must be downloaded and properly configured for facial recognition functionality. This project offers a reliable and advanced authentication solution suitable for applications requiring high security and user identity verification."**
